The Burrito Project won the 1st place in the Data Science Presentation Showcase at Cornell MSBA '23 program!

This application will take your listening history from Spotify, analyze and generate a dashboard that gives you a cat representative of your mood, with awesome statistics of listening history, and recommend songs based on your general mood.
